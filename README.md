# Character generator

This is a work in progress.

This is a program that will randomly sample a plausible fictional character based on real demographic data (idea originally from [gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Statistical-notes#technology)). To use, run this program in your favorite IDE and incorporate the characters generated therein into your fictional literature. 

(You can postselect - i.e. intentionally use only a subset of the characters generated, (say) only rightists, or Muslims - but we *strongly* suggest using every character generated for maximum realism. We plan to implement explicit postselection into our program sometime.)
